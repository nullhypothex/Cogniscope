# Early Alzheimer's Detection via Digital Behavior and Language Drift

This repository implements a simulation-based framework for early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) detection using digital behavior signals and language coherence metrics derived from synthetic social media-style video interactions. Inspired by neuropsychological assessments like MMSE and ADAS-Cog, the system tracks attention, memory, and semantic clarity via daily video engagement, free-form summaries, and question-answering tasks.

## Project Overview

- **Users Simulated:** 200
- **Duration:** 200 days
- **Videos per Day:** 5 (from 5 categories: News, Sports, Health, etc.)
- **Key Outputs:** Behavioral logs, linguistic summaries, coherence scores, engagement metrics
- **Main Goal:** Predict cognitive states (Healthy, MCI, EarlyAD) from temporal behavior + summary coherence

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nullhypothex/Cogniscope.git
cd EarlyADdetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
